## TODOMVC - simple example (2016/10/29)

To apply the React training, I created a Todo app based on todomvc.com’s example.

*Solution I developed* (using TodoMVC’s output HTML and CSS stylesheets):
[http://jsbin.com/rahize](http://jsbin.com/rahize/edit?html,js,output)
This could likely use a bit of refactoring, but is a functional first pass at this exercise. Will try a multi-file solution with Flux at some point. Or maybe I’ll just rebuild it from the starting point a few times to get really quick at solving the small challenges I faced along the way.

*Starter file* for building a solution:
[http://jsbin.com/gazege](http://jsbin.com/gazege/edit?html,js,output)

Open to feedback about the solution and the process.

*If the output panel doesn’t load right away, edit a string in the output file after a few seconds and the output should render.
